Project: UART (UNIVERSAL ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVER-TRANSMITTER) DESIGN

OVERVIEW:

Objective:
Design a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) module in Verilog or VHDL, simulate its functionality, and verify its correctness using a VLSI software environment.

Key activities:

1. Design UART module: Create a UART module in Verilog or VHDL, including the transmitter and receiver blocks.
2. Implement UART protocol: Implement the UART protocol, including start bit, data bits, parity bit, and stop bit generation and detection.
3. Simulate UART module: Simulate the UART module using a VLSI software environment to verify its functionality.
4. Verify UART communication: Use the VLSI software's communication interface features to emulate UART communication and verify the correctness of the UART module.
5. Test and debug: Test and debug the UART module to ensure its correct functionality.


Technologies used:

1. Verilog or VHDL: Hardware description languages used for designing digital circuits, including the UART module.
2. VLSI software environment: A software environment used for designing, simulating, and verifying digital circuits, Xilinx Vivado.
3. UART protocol: A communication protocol used for asynchronous serial communication, including start bit, data bits, parity bit, and stop bit generation and detection.
4. Communication interface features: Features within the VLSI software environment used to emulate UART communication, such as serial communication interfaces or UART controllers.
